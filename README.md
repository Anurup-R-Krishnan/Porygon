# Porygon

A container runtime security and behavioral anomaly detection system for Docker.

Porygon monitors container execution at the kernel level using modern eBPF (via Falco) and correlates process activity with Docker daemon lifecycle events. It builds per-image behavioral baselines, measures execution drift using Jensen-Shannon distance, enforces deterministic detection rules, and supports automated or human-approved container containment.

---

## Features

- **Kernel-Level Telemetry**: Captures process execution events (`execve`/`execveat`) in real time using modern eBPF probes.
- **Digest-Bound Baselines**: Profiles expected process behavior bound to cryptographic image digests (`sha256:...`) rather than mutable image tags.
- **Behavioral Anomaly Scoring**: Calculates runtime drift using Jensen-Shannon divergence to identify unexpected processes and abnormal tool usage.
- **ML Threat Classification**: Classifies runtime telemetry into MITRE attack tactics (`shell_escape`, `reconnaissance`, `suspicious_tooling`, `privilege_escalation`, `benign`) using an explainable Random Forest ensemble with TreeSHAP feature attribution.
- **Rule Engine & AI Auditor**: Detects shell escapes, privilege escalation, unknown binaries, and suspicious executions, supplemented by automated incident summaries.
- **Automated / Approved Containment**: Quarantines compromised containers (pause or stop) with configurable human-in-the-loop approval workflows.
- **Vulnerability & SBOM Context**: Scans images with Trivy and enriches findings with EPSS exploit probabilities and CISA KEV exploitation data.
- **Interactive Web Dashboard**: Clean UI for live telemetry streaming, behavioral score visualization, incident review, and response actions.

## Machine Learning Threat Classification

Porygon pairs continuous kernel eBPF observation with a supervised **Random Forest ensemble** and **TreeSHAP additive feature attribution**. Rather than treating machine learning as an opaque scoring mechanism, Porygon classifies runtime process telemetry directly into standardized **MITRE ATT&CK tactics** while mathematically explaining every prediction down to individual feature contributions.

### Multi-Layer Detection Architecture

| Defense Layer | Detection Engine | Target Threat Vector | Evaluation Latency | Output Representation | Explainability Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Statistical Drift** | Jensen-Shannon Divergence | Unseen process churn & baseline deviation | < 0.2 ms | Continuous distance score (`0.00`–`1.00`) | Digest symbol distribution delta |
| **Deterministic Rules** | Falco eBPF Kernel Probes | Known exploits (`setuid`, cgroup escape, shim bypass) | Real-time (< 0.1 ms) | Boolean incident alerts | Syscall argument match & trace |
| **Supervised ML** | Calibrated Random Forest Ensemble | Stealthy multi-stage attack tactics & intent | < 1.5 ms | MITRE tactic probabilities + verdict | Exact TreeSHAP additive feature attributions ($\Delta \mathbf{P}$) |
| **Generative AI** | Local LLM Auditor (Claude/Ollama) | Complex alert correlation & blast-radius analysis | 1.5 s – 3.0 s | Plain-language remediation brief | Chain-of-thought markdown narrative |

### MITRE ATT&CK Tactic Mapping

| MITRE Attack Tactic | Target MITRE ID | Threat Severity | Primary Behavioral Indicators | Associated Binaries & Tooling | Porygon Automated Response |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`benign`** | N/A | `CLEAN` | Strict adherence to baseline digest profile; 0 unseen binaries | Container entrypoint, standard daemons (`nginx`, `node`, `python`) | Continuously monitor & refine baseline |
| **`reconnaissance`** | T1046, T1082 | `MEDIUM` | Host/network discovery, process tree enumeration, interface probing | `nmap`, `ifconfig`, `netstat`, `ping`, `ss`, `ip`, `whoami` | Alert operator & log forensic snapshot |
| **`privilege_escalation`** | T1068, T1548 | `CRITICAL` | Sudo capability abuse, root transition spikes, namespace manipulation | `sudo`, `su`, `pkexec`, `nsenter`, `capsh`, `chroot`, dirty pipe probes | Restrict cgroups & alert operator |
| **`shell_escape`** | T1611, T1059 | `CRITICAL` | Interactive shell spawned directly from runtime shim (`docker exec`) | `/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`, `dash`, unprofiled shell invocations | Automated containment (pause/stop container) |
| **`suspicious_tooling`** | T1059, T1496 | `HIGH` | Network egress fetchers, compiler invocations, crypto-mining loops | `curl`, `wget`, `socat`, `nc`, `xmrig`, `gcc`, `make` | Revoke network egress & trigger containment lease |

### 12-Dimensional Extracted Feature Vector

The ML classifier ingests 12 normalized telemetry features derived from kernel `execve` events and container baseline digests:

| Feature Name | Value Range | Behavioral Semantic Description | Threat Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`shell_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Proportion of executions invoking `/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`, or `dash` | Interactive shell presence inside non-shell microservice |
| **`recon_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Proportion of executions invoking network or system discovery commands | Attacker reconnaissance and host discovery |
| **`tooling_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Frequency of file-fetch or reverse-shell binaries (`curl`, `wget`, `nc`) | Malicious payload staging and command-and-control ingress |
| **`priv_escalation_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Invocations of privilege elevation utilities (`sudo`, `su`, `nsenter`) | Container breakout and root privilege escalation |
| **`compiler_miner_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Invocations of development compilers or cryptomining software | Resource hijacking and unauthorized compilation |
| **`root_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Proportion of process executions running as `root` (UID 0) | Violation of least-privilege container runtime principles |
| **`parent_shim_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Processes spawned directly under `containerd-shim` / `docker-runc` | External operator `docker exec` injection |
| **`distinct_proc_count`** | `[0, ∞)` | Number of unique binary executables launched during the window | High process diversity indicates interactive intruder activity |
| **`event_count`** | `[0, ∞)` | Total volume of process execution events recorded | Execution churn and volume anomalies |
| **`unseen_executable_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Fraction of executables absent from the cryptographic baseline | Code execution outside pre-approved container images |
| **`suspicious_sequence_ratio`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Sequences matching rapid recon-to-exploit chaining patterns | Multi-step automated cyber kill-chain execution |
| **`jensen_shannon_drift`** | `[0.0, 1.0]` | Jensen-Shannon distance against the baseline process distribution | Global behavioral divergence from expected workload profile |

### TreeSHAP Mathematical Explainability

To satisfy strict regulatory and security audit requirements, Porygon rejects black-box classifications. Each prediction is accompanied by exact TreeSHAP local additive feature attributions:

$$\mathbf{f}(x) = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{12} \phi_i(x)$$

Where $\phi_0$ is the base expected model value and $\phi_i(x)$ represents the exact marginal contribution of feature $i$ pushing the probability toward or away from a given MITRE tactic.
